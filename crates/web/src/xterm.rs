//! Minimal `wasm-bindgen` FFI to xterm.js + the FitAddon.
//!
//! We import only the surface the terminal tile needs today —
//! constructor, `open`, `write`, `onData`, `resize`, dim
//! getters, `loadAddon`, and `dispose`. Future slices may add
//! `clear`, `reset`, `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` (for
//! Cmd+V interception once the clipboard bridge port lands),
//! `serialize` / `selection` / `search`, and the WebGL,
//! ClipboardAddon, and SearchAddon constructors. Keep this file
//! tight: each `#[wasm_bindgen]` extern adds bytes to the bundle
//! even when unused, because wasm-bindgen emits a JS shim per
//! method.
//!
//! **Module path discipline.** The two `raw_module = "/xterm/..."`
//! attributes are absolute browser paths, not Rust module
//! names. `raw_module` (vs. `module`) tells wasm-bindgen NOT
//! to read the JS file at compile time — the path is preserved
//! verbatim in the generated `import { ... } from "..."`
//! statement and resolved by the browser's ES module loader at
//! runtime. Trunk's `copy-dir` directive in `index.html` lands
//! the vendored assets under `dist/xterm/`, so `/xterm/...`
//! resolves to a 200. If the path stops matching the trunk
//! drop location the import fails at runtime with a 404 and
//! the WASM bundle hangs at `Terminal::new` — there is no
//! compile-time check. Same constraint as the JS frontend's
//! `import { Terminal } from "/vendor/xterm/xterm.esm.js"` —
//! the URL space is the contract.
//!
//! **Why a thin wrapper, not the `xterm-js-rs` crate.** The
//! published `xterm-js-rs` crate is unmaintained (last release
//! 2023) and pins to xterm 4.x; we ship 5.5+ via the vendored
//! ESM. The full xterm API surface is also wider than we need —
//! ~30 methods we'll never call. A 60-line hand-rolled shim
//! is cheaper than auditing and patching a stale crate.
//!
//! **No `Drop` for `Terminal`.** xterm's `dispose()` is the
//! cleanup; we expose it as `Terminal::dispose(&self)` for
//! callers who hold a long-lived terminal in `store_value`. The
//! tile component drops the `Terminal` JsValue when it
//! unmounts, but the underlying xterm instance only releases
//! its internal allocations once `dispose` is called. The tile
//!'s mount-time RAII calls it in the cleanup closure.
